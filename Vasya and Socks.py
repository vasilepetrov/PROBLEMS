'''
Vasya has n pairs of socks. In the morning of each day Vasya has to put on a pair of socks before he goes to school.
When he comes home in the evening, Vasya takes off the used socks and throws them away. Every m-th day (at days with numbers m, 2m, 3m, ...) mom buys a pair of socks to Vasya. She does it late in the evening, so that Vasya cannot put on a new pair of socks before the next day. How many consecutive days pass until Vasya runs out of socks?

Input
The single line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100; 2 ≤ m ≤ 100), separated by a space.

Output
Print a single integer — the answer to the problem.

ints = input().split(' ')
n, m = [int(x) for x in ints]
cnt = n

while n >= m:
    cnt += n // m
    n = n // m + n % m

print(cnt)
